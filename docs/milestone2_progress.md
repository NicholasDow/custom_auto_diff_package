1. What tasks has each group member been assigned to for Milestone 2:
    - Sam has been assigned the implementation and documentation of the dual number class and operations. She will also complete test implementations for the Graph class and implementation of auto differentiation.
    - Nick has been assigned the implementation and documentation of the Graph class as well as ensuring that numpy arrays are supported as input for the functions. He will complete testing for the AutoDiff class.
    - Alex has been assigned the implementation and documentation of the AutoDiff class. He will complete testing for the dual number class.
 
2. What has each group member done since the submission of Milestone 1.
    - All group members met and collaborated to add the changes to the Milestone 1 proposal.
    - Sam has completed an untested implementation of the dual numbers class that includes elementary operations, exponents, and trig functions.
    - Nick has begun to outline his part for the Graph class and support for numpy arrays
    - Alex has also begun outlining his part for the AutoDiff class and has studied the PP7 lab to help with his efforts.
 
 
Additional Notes:
    - Our group plans to have a working implementation of all parts completed by next Tuesday to account for any unexpected issues that might arise.
